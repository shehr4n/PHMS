# PHMS

PHMS **(Personal Health Monitoring System)** is an application that helps users maintain various personal health-related data. Users can create accounts and enter their physical health information and details about their medication, diet, etc. PHMS uses this information to keep the user on track with their needs and goals.

## **Components:**

**Registration and Login:** Users can register by entering personal information such as their name, gender, age, weight, height, doctor’s name, and details of medical visits (e.g., doctor visit dates, annual checkups). The system ensures secure login to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive health data is protected and cannot be tampered with.

**Vital Signs Tracking:** The system allows users to register vital signs like blood pressure, glucose levels, and cholesterol readings. This helps users and their healthcare providers to monitor health conditions and make timely interventions if needed.

**Medication Management:** PHMS enables users to log the medications they are taking, including dosage, frequency, and time of intake. A notification/alert system will remind users when to take their medication, ensuring better adherence to prescribed schedules.

**Diet Tracking:** Users can log their food intake, track their calorie consumption, and monitor their weight. This feature helps users maintain a healthy diet and stay aligned with their health goals.

**Notes and Health Resources:** PHMS provides a space for users to store important health-related notes, such as favorite recipes, diet descriptions, and health articles. This allows users to keep useful information within easy reach.

**Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific health-related data, such as the date of their next doctor’s appointment, details of past medications, or diet logs. This feature ensures that users can quickly access important information when needed.

**Monitoring System:** The system includes a monitoring feature that alerts users, family members, or designated caregivers (such as doctors or pharmacists) if a medication is missed or if there is a potential conflict between medications that could lead to life-threatening consequences.

**Communication:** PHMS facilitates communication by providing options for email, phone calls, and text messages, ensuring that users can share important information with healthcare providers or family members in case of emergencies.

**Data Maintenance:** The system is designed to allow easy maintenance of data. Users can easily update or add new information, such as adding a new doctor or changing medication details, without requiring any programming skills.

**GPS Location Integration:** PHMS will integrate GPS location features, enabling users to track the location of their doctors and healthcare facilities. This can be particularly useful for individuals managing chronic conditions who need to locate medical resources quickly
